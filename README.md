# HQ UDG Catalog and UDGnet-K Resources

This repository provides resources for our work on the identification and analysis of high-quality ultra-diffuse galaxy (HQ UDG) candidates using deep learning methods.

In response to community standards for reproducibility and transparency in machine learning research, we make our **HQ UDG catalog, training sample, model scripts, and trained weights** publicly available.

## 📄 HQ UDG Catalog

- **File:** `table1.csv`
- **Description:**  
  This file contains the catalog of **545 HQ UDG candidates** used in this work.  
  The table includes the main photometric, structural, and identification parameters for each UDG candidate selected by our pipeline.

## 🧠 Model, Training Data, and Weights

Due to the large data volume, the training dataset, model architecture, and trained weights are hosted on Google Drive:

🔗 **Public Data & Model Repository:**  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PZRFNrQX3g4_tAkOT4nMpsCeK-6C8gQu?usp=drive_link

This folder contains:
- 📦 The **training dataset** used to train UDGnet-K  
- 🧬 The **model scripts** for training and inference  
- 🏋️ The **final trained weights** of UDGnet-K  
- 📝 Configuration files and auxiliary scripts
- ## 📌 Citation

If you use these data or the UDGnet-K model in your work, please cite our paper accordingly:
